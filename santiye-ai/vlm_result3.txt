Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.
The argument `trust_remote_code` is to be used with Auto classes. It has no effect here and is ignored.

You're using a LlamaTokenizerFast tokenizer. Please note that with a fast tokenizer, using the `__call__` method is faster than using a method to encode the text followed by a call to the `pad` method to get a padded encoding.
Python version is above 3.10, patching the collections module.
